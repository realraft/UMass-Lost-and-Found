Nathan Dennis 

Notetaker

Will be taking down notes, and recording what my teammates do in regards to the website. Will also offer suggestions and implement them when necessary

Will also contribute to other parts of the code. 

Will mainly work on the front-end. Already did the initial back-bone of the wireframe.
